AI PR Reviewer
In this repo the main branch has an LLM based AI PR Reviewer agent setup in the github actions workflow. In other feature branches there are test codes present with security issues and vulnerabilities. Idea is that whenever a developer try to merge their feature branch into main via PR, the AI reviewer agent will trigger automatically, scan the code for vulnerabilities, if clean allow it to be merged, if find any vulnerabilities state the details of vulnerabilities present in the code and advise how to fix it, block the merge and assign appropriate reviewer based on the type of code. Currently as an example it has two reviewers set as collaborators and has two types of code python and javascript. If the issue is in python, a specific one from the collaborators will be assigned and if javascript then the other one. In case of both types of codes present, both of them will be assigned as reviewers.
The AI reviewer agent is created through open source api token of GROQ with LLAMA 3 as the LLM Model to generate prompts.
